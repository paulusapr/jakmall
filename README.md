Honestly I have never used VueJS, this is my first time using it. Still not perfect and not as requested, but I have done as much as possible that I can do. Because I was late working because of the rarity of checking emails and the time that had passed the limit finally I decided to give results as is.

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies

npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
